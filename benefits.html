                <h2>Music Activates The Brain</h2>
                <p>
                    Music has been shown to activate some of the broadest and most diverse networks of the brain.
                    It is able to activate our auditory cortex in our temporal lobes which are located close to our ears.
                    Parts of the brain that are involved in our emotions that we feel are not only activated when listening to emotional music but they are also synchronized with them!
                    Music also unlocks many memories and interestingly, activates our motor system!

                <h2>Use It Or Lose It</h2>
                <p>
                    You may be wondering why is it so important & why is it beneficial for our brain to activate?
                    Results have shown that when using our brain, not only do our brain pathways but the whole networks of our brain are strengthened!
                    Likewise, when they are not used, they are weakened.
                    The reason is that the brain is efficient; it will not keep a brain pathway strong if it is not used.
                    Brain neurons in that pathway will be used for something else.
                    This is why it is harder to speak a language that you have not used in 20 years; many of the old pathways have degraded and its neurons are used for other purposes.

                <h2>Music keeps our brain networks strong</h2>
                <p>
                    Music is not only able to promote well-being, but it is also able to enhance learning, stimulate cognitive function, imrpove quality of life and even induce happiness!
                    Why is music so powerful?
                    This is because music can activate almost all brain regions and networks, which means that it can keep a myriad of the brain pathways & networks strong, including networks that are involved in the mentioned benefits.
