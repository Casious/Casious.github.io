                    Researchers were able to find out about ancient music by studying the drawings on walls, vases, and other objects, which allowed them to deduce that instruments similar to modern day bagpipes existed even back in Ancient Greece. 
                    With this method, they also discovered the existence of string instruments (such as the lyre) and flutes (the aulos).

                    Polyphony together with a new notation system that set the foundation of music for the ones that we still use today blossomed in the Middle Age.
                    During the Middle Age, music was mostly devotional, although there was a secular current mostly dealing with tales of love & cavalry.
                    Instruments in medieval music such as flutes,lutes and dulcimers were popular.
                    Many popular modern songs are turned into this historical style as it is quite trendy.

                    During the Renaissance, composers laid the foundation of Baroque music.
                    The development of counterpoint and the use of chromatism actually inspired many popular Baroque artists such as Bach and Vivaldi.
                    During the Baroque period, composers started creating music for richer ensembles which then developed into full orchestras.
                    Some of which are still in use today such as the sonata & the fugue. Both of which were invented during the Baroque period.

                    From the XVII to the early XX century, many composers from Mozart to Beethoven, from Haydn to Schubert, many of them experimented with different forms, melodic ideas and harmoic solutions as well as instruments.
                    Hence, creating lots of popular classical music that we know today.
                    This Classical era led to the development of new singing form which mixed music and theater which is known as the Opera today. Symphonies also became very popular.

                <p>Outside Europe, a brand new approach to music was taken in the Afro-American communities.
                    Jazz & Blues set a paramount foundation for all the other contemporary genres, just as European classical music had done.
                    Jazz songs took over the mainstream and remained solid protagonists up until the Sixties, through a lot of differnet currents & sub-genres such as bebop.

                    Throughout the fifties, a revolution happened;rock'n'roll appeared and blasted the music scene.
                    Originating directly from the blues form, it quickly became a trend and influenced many aspects of culture and society.
                    It became a strong foundation for many sub-genres,extending to pop music.
                    Groups like The Beatles worked as a bridge between these two different worlds.

                    The development of new technologies as well as computers allowed artists to approach music in a whole different manner.
                    Instruments were no longer required to compose a tune and a simple piece of software or electronice device could be used to compose music.
                    Electronic tools and resources are very present in today's mainstream music.
                    Although the song structures still maintain the standards of classic rock and pop music that has been heard since the Fifties.
